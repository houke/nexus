# Nexus Plugin

Multi-agent orchestration system for GitHub Copilot. Provides a team of specialized AI personas that collaborate to plan, build, and review software — each with a distinct role, memory, and handoff protocol.

## Workflow Prompts

The plugin ships with a set of orchestration prompts accessible from `.github/prompts/`:

| Prompt            | Description                                                     |

| `nexus-review`    | Comprehensive code review with automatic fixes.                 |
| `nexus-hotfix`    | Expedited workflow for small, well-understood bugs.             |

| `nexus-summary`   | Project status snapshot — "have" vs "need".                     |

## How It Works

The **Nexus Orchestrator** (`@nexus`) acts as a team lead. When you invoke a workflow prompt, it:

1. Analyzes your request and determines which specialists are needed
2. Delegates to each agent via `runSubagent` with tailored instructions
3. Synthesizes all responses into a unified output
4. Always closes with a QA + Tech Lead review cycle

Agents can also hand off to each other directly — for example, `@architect` hands implementation details to `@software-developer`, which then hands testing to `@qa-engineer`.
